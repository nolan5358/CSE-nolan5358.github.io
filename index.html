  <!--ITEC101-Values-->
  <section class="assign">
    <p>
      Personal Values
      - Intelligence, Discipline, Respect, Finincal Stability, Influence
        - These five values all resonate with me and derive from how I have been raised my whole life and my parents having similar values morphed my mind to have the same. These values are important to me for many reasons, Intelligence and discipline are something that can lead you in the right path in life and create opportunitys that then provide that value of finnancial stability. Respect is something that will always come around back to you, I think its important to trat others the way you want to be treated and I want to be respected. Influence is something that can help other people and yourself in many different ways which is why it is important to me.
        - Not adhearing to these values is not the end of the world but it there shouldnt be any reasons to not follow them. These values will onlyprovide personal gain and fortune so if people do not adhear to them they are missing out on a life that eliminates problems.
